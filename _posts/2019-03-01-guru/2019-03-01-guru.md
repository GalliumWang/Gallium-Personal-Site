## One small thing leads to bigger things.

I spent a few months working with teams of developers, mostly as a way to brush up on my React skills.

Here is a taste of the a few things I worked on:

## 1. Better onboarding experience

Blank screens for each of the tabs.

## 2. New content sharing workflow

(coming soon)

## 3. Various accessibility improvements

Checkbox, reduced motion, etc.

## 4+n. A ton of other tiny things

- Getting React Developer Tools to work _inside_ Chrome'e extension sandbox
- Fixing an issue with `git-flow-avh`
- Debugging Electron apps
- Etc
