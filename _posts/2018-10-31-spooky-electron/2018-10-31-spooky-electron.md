Here's a fun talk I gave at BrooklynJS October 2018! You can find code and alt text for the slides at <a href="https://github.com/pixelyunicorn/spooky-electron-apps" class="uno" target="_blank"><img src="https://icon.now.sh/github/000" height="12" width="12" /> pixelyunicorn/spooky-electron-apps</a>.

(At some point in the _near future_ I will turn this page into a writeup with a walkthrough featuring code and screenshots!)
