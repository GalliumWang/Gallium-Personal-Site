I created a series of guides to help students find their way around campus.

As part of my advisory role with SEPTA, I collaborated with the members of the Youth Advisory Council to build a series of printable and responsive web-based guides to help college students find they way around the region.

These brochures are distributed at information desks and event tables at colleges throughout the Philadelphia area.
