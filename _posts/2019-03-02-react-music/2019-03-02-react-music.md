I am working on a talk to be given at React meetups this summer. In the meantime, here's a (rough) otline:

10 mins: react-music overview
- intro to making music in general
- then dive into the power of react-music

5 mins: tying it with visualizations
- viz libraries

10 mins: actually making music (live demo!)
- minimal live coding, or rather live uncommenting
