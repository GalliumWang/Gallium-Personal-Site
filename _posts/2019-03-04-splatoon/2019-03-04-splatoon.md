Splatoon is this really cool game I play that involves splatting other players with ink. I'm proud to be part of a friendly and community that's quite hard to come across, especially in esports.

## I'm on Twitch!

I'm really just here to have a great time, so sit back, stay for a while, and send me some positive vibes! ðŸ‘‹

As part of my setup, I designed a digital graphics package for my stream.

### Design System

I worked on a design system for my streams, and additionally future tournaments I may or may not be putting together.

<!-- (TODO: put repo on GitHub) -->

### Philips Hue integration

At the beginning of each match, each team is randomly assigned a color. Using the power of OpenCV, I tossed together a python script that detects your team's color and changes the ambient lighting of the room to match that color!

<!-- TODO: put python script on GitHub -->

### OBS Overlays

I worked on an overlay for OBS that displays the current stages and modes. (GitHub @pixelyunicorn/splat-overlay)

### Mixer Overlay

I am currently experimenting with Mixer's overlay system and building an interactive overlay that allows viewers to see results before the appear on screen, and view previous matches.
