<p class="lead"><strong>Splatoon 2</strong> is Nintendo's latest and freshest multiplayer game where inklings and octolings fight for turf using art-inspired weapons— it's super fun to play and even more interesting to watch! I'm proud to be part of a esports community is as friendly and inclusive as it gets!</p>

As part of my Twitch stream series and as a member of the Splatoon community, I worked on a bunch of various jawns to help players improve their game and style!

## Design System

I designed a digital graphics package and design system for my Twitch stream, and additional graphics for future Splatoon-related events such as tournaments and meetups! Here is just a sample of the assets I use in my jawns:

_Channel introduction:_

_Game mode icons:_

_Game modes, explained:_

_Streamlabs alerts:_

_Banner system for HRG esports:_

![banner]({{ page.assets }}splatoon-banner.png)

(PS the game mode icons have been made into stickers!!)

## Current Stages Overlay

I worked on an overlay for OBS that displays the current stages and modes. You can find it online at [pixelyunicorn.github.io/splat-overlay](https://pixelyunicorn.github.io/splat-overlay/). Feel free to embed this page into your streams!

## Philips Hue integration

At the beginning of each match, each team is randomly assigned a color. Using the power of OpenCV, I tossed together a python script that detects your team's color and changes the ambient lighting of the room to match that color!

> TODO: Create GIF and put script on GitHub

## Mixer Overlay

I am currently experimenting with Mixer's overlay system and building an interactive overlay that allows viewers to see live results (seconds before they appear on screen), and view previous matches. This will be the subject of a future talk at a Vue or Tech x Gaming meetup near you!

## Teams, Orgs, 'n' Events

I stay fresh with playing, subbing, or just hanging out with profreshional squid game teams. Here's where you can currnetly find me:

- Hormone Replacement Gaming (HRG)
- Tuffer Puffers
- Crown Fresh
- Squids in a Steel Furnace

I have also participated in these tournaments:

- Smash 'N' Splash (Wiscousion Dells WI)
- Breakon (Deer Park NY)
- Long Island Splat (Deer Park NY)
- Splatboro (Hatboro PA)
- Landfall (Hollywood FL)
