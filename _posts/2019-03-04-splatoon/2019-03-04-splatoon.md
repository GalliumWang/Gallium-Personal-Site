<p class="lead"><strong>Splatoon 2</strong> is this really cool game I play that involves splatting other players with ink. I'm proud to be part of a friendly and community that's quite hard to come across, especially in esports.</p>

Here are some of the other things I worked on:

## Design System

As part of my setup, I designed a digital graphics package for my stream, and additional graphics for future spkatoon-related events such as tournaments and meetups!

## Code Experiments

### Philips Hue integration

At the beginning of each match, each team is randomly assigned a color. Using the power of OpenCV, I tossed together a python script that detects your team's color and changes the ambient lighting of the room to match that color!

> TODO: Create GIF

### Current Stages Overlay

I worked on an overlay for OBS that displays the current stages and modes. You can find it online and embed it yourself at [https://pixelyunicorn.github.io/splat-overlay/](https://pixelyunicorn.github.io/splat-overlay/)

### Mixer Overlay

I am currently experimenting with Mixer's overlay system and building an interactive overlay that allows viewers to see results before the appear on screen, and view previous matches.

> TODO: Screenshots coming soon!

## Teams

I play, sub, and hang out with a bunch of fresh teams.
