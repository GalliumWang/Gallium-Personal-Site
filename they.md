Yep, there's more than one of us in this brain! I highly reccomend reading <a href="https://freyasspirit.com/plurality-playbook/" class="uno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google's Plurality Playbook</a> for context on understanding dissociative disorders, as well as plurality as a whole. Here are some of us you will be seeing around:

- 🎶 **Melody** ~ they/them ~ right brain ~ the musical one, slurs voice musically, has the most common sense and primary communicator

- 🦌 **valerie** ~ vi/vim or val ~ left brain ~ the lowercase personality, can focus, total nerrrrrrd, tries to be an obnoxiously cute unicorn deerling

- 🔥 **Ambra (amber)** ~ she/her ~ can design and code (aka can make money) 

- 🌿 **Forrest** ~ any pronouns ~ non-verbal, loves tacos and nature, hates chicken

I go into a bit more detail in this <a href="https://twitter.com/pixelyunicorn/status/1095153748354117632" class="uno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter thread</a>. (I will still mostly refer to myself using "I", however "we" will be used in contexts in appropriate.)
